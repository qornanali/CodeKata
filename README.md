# CodeKata - A Journey to become Coding Master

**Kata** is an exercise in Karate to execute a specified series of a variety of moves,
with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form.
It teaches the student about proper form and position to helped them
visualize different scenarios for each motion and technique.
Traditionally, kata is taught in stages.
Previously learned kata are repeated to show better technique or power
as a student acquires knowledge and experience.
It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned
but at an improved level of quality.


**Code Kata** is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development.
The intent behind code kata is similar to Karate Kata.
Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long).
It repeated for many many many times with adding little improvements for each cycle.
Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways.
Some involve thinking about the issues behind programming and design.
These are unlikely to have a single correct answer.
